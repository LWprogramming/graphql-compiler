"""Perform optimizations and lowering of the IR that allows the compiler to emit MATCH queries.

The compiler IR allows blocks and expressions that cannot be directly compiled to Gremlin or MATCH.
For example, ContextFieldExistence is an Expression that returns True iff its given vertex exists,
but the produced Gremlin and MATCH outputs for this purpose are entirely different and not easy
to generate directly from this Expression object. An output-language-aware IR lowering step allows
us to convert this Expression into other Expressions, using data already present in the IR,
to simplify the final code generation step.
